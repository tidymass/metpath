\title{Remove Redundant Annotations in Metabolite Data}
\usage{
remove_redundancy(annotation_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotation_table}{A data frame containing metabolite annotations,
including `Lab.ID`, `variable_id`, and `score` columns.}
}
\value{
A filtered version of the annotation table with reduced redundancy.
}
\description{
This function removes redundant metabolite annotations by filtering out low-confidence matches.
It iteratively refines the annotation table based on score thresholds.
}
\details{
The function follows these rules:
- If a compound has an annotation with a score > 80, it removes annotations with scores ≤ 20.
- If a peak has an annotation with a score > 80, it removes other annotations with scores ≤ 20.
- Iterates until redundancy stabilizes, ensuring that lower-quality annotations are removed.
